# Python File Handler: Read, Write, Operate, and Test

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates a structured approach to file handling in Python using multiple modules. It includes implementation of read, write, and operational logic across four main Python files, along with testing, pseudocode, and data structure analysis.

## Objectives
- Demonstrate modular programming in Python
- Implement and test file operations (read/write)
- Explore and document data types used
- Provide pseudocode and testing output

## Contents
- Introduction to the project and tools used  
- Explanation of each Python script: `main.py`, `read.py`, `write.py`, `operation.py`  
- Pseudocode and logic breakdown  
- Analysis of data structures: int, str, list  
- Testing scenarios and outcomes  
- Conclusion, bibliography, and appendix with full code listings
